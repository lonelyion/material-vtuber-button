## Contributing

If you don't know how to participate on GitHub, you can directly send voice clips or suggestions to [voice@fubuki.moe](mailto:voice@fubuki.moe) with title, content and your social ID(Twitter, Bilibili or so on). We will add your ID to the contributors list below.

Also you can submit [Issues](https://github.com/copperion/fubuki-button/issues) to upload audio clips.

If you can do some programming, just fork this repository and modify it. After you have done, just open a Pull Request. For detailed information, please read below.

### Add or modify voice

Voice is always in mp3 format with 128Kbps bitrate and stored in `static/voices/`. The corresponding URL is `/voices/`.

All voice meta data is stored in `assets/voices.json`. To add or modify these voices, you need to modify this file accordingly.

If you want to modify existed voice clips, I suggest deleting the origin file and name a new filename to avoid browers' cache problem.

### Participate in translation

Please help us translate to English and Japanese!

The language files for the main program are in three json files named the language name in `assets/locales/`.

The language files for voices are in `assets/voices.json`.

## Deploying a local development environment

This site is developed using Vue + NuxtJS + Vuetify.

To deploy a local development environment, first install the latest version of Node and Yarn. Then follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the code.

2. Go to the code directory and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

3. Run `yarn dev` to start local developemnt server at `localhost:3000`. The local development server can immediately reflect the results of your modification.

4. To compile the files for deployment, run `yarn generate`, which will generate the `dist` directory. This site is completely static, you can directly deploy the entire `dist` directory.
